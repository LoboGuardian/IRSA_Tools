Tools for International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet

The International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, also known as the NATO phonetic alphabet or ICAO phonetic alphabet, is an alphabet used to communicate letters of the alphabet over voice channels or other methods that are prone to miscommunication.

It is used by many organizations around the world, including aviation, military, and maritime communications. The alphabet consists of 26 words, each chosen to sound distinct from the others and to be easily understood in different languages.
